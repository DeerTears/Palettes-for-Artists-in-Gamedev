# Palettes for Gamemaking Artists
To help artists create assets for palette-restricted gamemaking programs.

Right now things are structured as `gamedev program/art program/palette file.extension`

You can help contribute to this repository by adding your palette files like so:

**Step 1.** Create folders so your palette file looks like this: ``GB Studio/Paint.net/gb_studio.txt``

**Step 2.** Zip the folder to look like this: ``GB Studio.zip`` 

**Step 3.** Fork this repository, then upload your zip file to your fork.

**Step 4.** Make a pull-request.

Don't worry about explaining what the pull-request it is since this isn't a big repo anyways.

### Note

The provided Asesprite palettes should also work with GIMP.
