# Palettes for Gamemaking Artists
To help artists create assets for palette-restricted gamemaking programs.

Right now things are structured as `gamedev program/art program/palette file.extension`

You can help contribute to this repository by adding your palette files like so:

**Step 1.** Create folders so your palette file looks like this: ``GB Studio/Paint.net/gb_studio.txt``

**Step 2.** Fork this repository and click "upload file"

**Step 3** On the website, drag the root folder (in this case ``GB Studio``) to the upload file area.

**Step 4.** Make a pull-request

Don't worry about explaining what the pull-request is since this isn't a big repo anyways.
