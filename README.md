# Palettes for Gamemaking Artists
To help artists create assets for palette-restricted gamemaking programs.

Right now things are structured as `gamedev program/art program/palette file.extension`

**Example:**
``GB Studio/Paint.net/gbstudio.txt``

Uploading a zipped folder with this file structure will put your file in the right set of folders.

**Example:**
Fork and upload ``GB Studio.zip`` as a new contribution.
